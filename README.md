# birdWatch

birdWatch should become more than some kind of egg-timer. 
By setting the time to minutes/seconds, an equal number of birds will swarm on the screen.
By starting the countdown to zero, each minute/second one bird will leave the swarm and fly away.
The audible-alarm at the end should be twittering of birds.
